Project Name: Memory Mesh Tagline: High-Fidelity Spatial Reconstruction via Decentralized GPU Oracles.

The Problem: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is the future of digital twins but requires massive VRAM, making it inaccessible to mobile users.

The AIDP Solution: Memory Mesh offloads the heavy "Structure from Motion" (SfM) and "Splat Training" phases to the AIDP Decentralized Network. By utilizing high-performance NVIDIA nodes on AIDP, we reduce 3D processing time from hours (on a CPU) to minutes.

GPU Usage: This project utilizes AIDP's high-memory nodes (RTX 3090/4090/H100) to handle the parallel processing of thousands of point-cloud images simultaneously.
