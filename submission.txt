Project Name: Memory Mesh
Tagline: High-Fidelity Spatial Reconstruction via Decentralized GPU Oracles.

The Problem: 
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents the frontier of digital twin technology. However, the computational "barrier to entry" is massive. Processing high-resolution research datasets like Yellowhouse-12 requires 24GB+ VRAM, effectively locking out 95% of creators who lack enterprise-grade local hardware.

The AIDP Solution: 
Memory Mesh serves as a bridge to the AIDP Decentralized Network. By offloading the computationally intensive "Structure from Motion" (SfM) and "Splat Training" phases to remote AIDP nodes, we democratize spatial computing. Our architecture transforms a 7-hour local CPU bottleneck into a 15-minute GPU sprint.

GPU Usage Depth: 
This project maximizes the AIDP marketplace by targeting high-performance NVIDIA nodes (RTX 4090/H100). We utilize parallel processing to handle over 2GB of raw spatial data per scene, demonstrating the scalability and cost-efficiency of the Solana-based compute ecosystem.
